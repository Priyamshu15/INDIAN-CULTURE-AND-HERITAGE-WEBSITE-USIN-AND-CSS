            <h2>Delhi</h2>
            <p>Delhi, the capital city of India, is known for its rich history and cultural heritage. It is home to iconic landmarks such as the Red Fort, Qutub Minar, and Jama Masjid.</p>
                <p><b>Culture of Delhi:</b><br>
                    Delhi is one of the high-power ancient regions, which has regained and improved cultural beauty throughout history with different empires controlling it. Delhi has a chaotic asymmetric beauty. One side of Delhi is still with the ancient style architecture, old winding lanes, age-old markets, and traditional communities. This Old Delhi is still holding its traditional values whereas New Delhi is getting flourished with modernization. This diversity in culture makes Delhi, a most prominent tourist attraction.</p>
                <p>Delhi is a city that bridges two different worlds. Old Delhi, once the capital of Islamic India, is a labyrinth of narrow lanes lined with crumbling havelis and formidable mosques. In contrast, the imperial city of New Delhi created by the British Raj is composed of spacious, tree-lined avenues and imposing government buildings. Delhi has been the seat of power for several rulers and many empires for about a millennium. Many a times the city was built, destroyed and then rebuilt here. Interestingly, a number of Delhi's rulers played a dual role, first as destroyers and then as creators.</p>
